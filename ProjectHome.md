# Pychat #

## **Overview** ##
Pychat is a simple server/client program that allows chatting through a GUI. It very much resembles IRC but also doubles as a learning experience for beginners in Python. The program uses TCP sockets and the program is available as a server or a client. The program is available in two different downloads, the server, and the client. The server is meant to be run on a remote machine, it has no GUI and only acts as a HUB for the chat. The client on the other hand can be pre-configured to automatically look for the servers IP address.

## **Features** ##
  * **coming soon** HTTP IP look up, where the client can look to a website for the IP of the server; this allows for the server to have a dynamic IP address.
  * upport for command codes that the client can enter such as '\user NAME' will change the user's name to NAME.
  * coming soon]Administrative command codes based on linux; '\sudo quit PASS' can remotely shutdown the chat server(this can be disabled for security reasons)
  * imple user friendly GUI written with the Tkinter GUI module.
